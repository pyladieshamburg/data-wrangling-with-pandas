# Data Wrangling with Pandas

During data preparation numerous tasks are performed and good tools are needed.

Pandas is a Python library for data manipulation, wrangling and analysis of tabular and time series data and is designed to make data analysis fast and easy.

In this Pyladies Hamburg event we become more Pandas-savy - together.  

## Panda Pocka
We boost our panda skills with a Panda Pocka Game Cards. You can find the Game Cards in this repos as well.

Inspired by Liberating Structures, we played Impromputu Networking with the Game Cards.  


We hope these tools help you spend more time gaining insights in your next project and less time manipulating your data.

## How to prepare for the game

First print out the cards in the pdf, should be double sided, and you need to cut out.. and laminate if you feel creative

## How to play it

You need a timer. Each player picks (randomly) 5 cards and gets 15 mins to properly understand them. All tools are allowed. 

When the time is up, teams of two are formed and in each team players chose a card from the other to have it explained. All the explained cards swap hands. When the time is up new teams are formed.. a player might have to explain a card they just got explained.. so they have to make sure they got it right :D

We did about 3 rounds.
