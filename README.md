Data Wrangling with Pandas

During data preparation numerous tasks are performed and good tools are needed.

Pandas is a Python library for data manipulation, wrangling and analysis of tabular and time series data and is designed to make data analysis fast and easy.

In this PyLadies event we become more Pandas-savy - together.  

We boost our panda skills with a Panda Pocka Game Cards. You can find the Game Cards here: 

Inspired by Liberating Structures, we played Impromput Networking with the Game Cards.  

We also made teams  to test our skills with the merge command.

We hope these tools help you spend more time gaining insights in your next project and less time manipulating your data.
