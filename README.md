# Data Wrangling with Pandas

During data preparation numerous tasks are performed and good tools are needed.

Pandas is a Python library for data manipulation, wrangling and analysis of tabular and time series data and is designed to make data analysis fast and easy.

In this Pyladies Hamburg event we become more Pandas-savy - together.  

## Panda Pocka
We boost our panda skills with a Panda Pocka Game Cards. You can find the Game Cards in this repos as well.

Inspired by Liberating Structures, we played Impromputu Networking with the Game Cards.  

## Pandas Merge 
We also asessed our skills with the pandas merge command. An interactive notebook of the quiz can be found here: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/chalendony/wrangle/master


We hope these tools help you spend more time gaining insights in your next project and less time manipulating your data.
